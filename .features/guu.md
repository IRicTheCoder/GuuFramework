# Guu Framework - Features
All features from Guu are listed here with some bullet points with their functions as well as description of each main features (or section). Some features do have small examples to explain them, but this is not a documentation file, it just tells you what features exist. All features point to the change logs that added them, to be easy to track the versions that have those features.

Documentation is currently being developed, this file will be edited to add the link here once that is done.
