# Eden Framework - Mod Relevant Features
Only features relevant to Modding are listed here. They are listed with some bullet points with their functions as well as a description of each main feature (or section). Some features do have small examples to explain them, but this is not a documentation file, nor it explores the entire features.

Eden can be upgraded to new versions as required, so the features listed here will point to Guu's change log where the version with that feature was first introduced to Guu.

Features and documentation can be found on Eden's Github page (Currently unavailable).
